## Notes

- You are free to select whichever license best fits your project or organizational requirements.
- CC0-1.0 is the closest to a true public domain dedication, but MIT and Apache-2.0 are provided for compatibility with organizations that require explicit license texts and patent clauses.
- All three licenses are recognized by SPDX and supported by Cargo (`license = "CC0-1.0 OR MIT OR Apache-2.0"`).
